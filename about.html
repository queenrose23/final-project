   <h1>Our Story</h1>
   <p>Over the years, engineers, estate agents, designers
     and architects <br> struggled to effectively communicate 
     their <br> ideas and visions to their clients.</p>
    <p>As a result, this team of passionate and innovative
       individuals came <br> together with a shared vision to
       revolutionize the way projects are <br> captured, visualized
       and presented. Thus, ViewE was born. </p>
